                Honey bees play a vital role as pollinators in Florida, essential for many plants that produce fruits, vegetables, and nuts. However, sometimes they are found in places too close to people or animals, which can pose risk. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Many colonies of the Honey bees establish in roof and wall holes of the any building, under houses, trees, water meter box, attics, etc. It's important to manage these situations carefully to ensure the safety of people, animals and these crucial pollinators.

                If you see bees nearby, do not try to control them yourself; it is important to remember that bees are incredibly complex and delicate creatures. Trying to manage a bee colony on your own can be risky,  both for you and for the bees. Without proper knowledge and experience, it’s easy to disturb the delicate balance of the hive or provoke the bees, leading to dangerous situations. Bees can become agitated, and the risks of stings or harm to the colony increase.
